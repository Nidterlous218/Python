"""
Start with your program from Exercise 9-1. Add an attribute called 
number_served with a default value of 0. Create an instance called 
restaurant from this class. Print the number of customers the restaurant 
has served, and then change this value and print it again.

Add a method called set_number_served() that lets you set the number 
of customers that have been served. Call this method with a new number 
and print the value again. Add a method called increment_number_served() 
that lets you increment the number of customers whoâ€™ve been served. 
Call this method with any number you like that could represent 
how many customers were served in, say, a day of business."""
